System Requirements
-------------------

This shell extension requires Windows Vista or above. It does not
work on Windows XP and previous versions of Windows.

The released installer checks for Windows 7 or above, so it can not
be used directly on Windows Vista.

The binaries were compiled using Visual Studio 2015. They are linked
statically against the C++ runtime, so no extra runtime libraries are
needed for this to work.


Installing
----------

Executing the installer should work without any trouble.

Installing the shell extensions by `regsvr32` is *not* supported.


Using
-----

Once this library is registered on the system, it will automatically
work inside Windows Explorer and other shell components (e.g. File
Dialogs) without needing further actions.


Building From Source
--------------------

The project has been compiled and tested with CMake 3.4.3 using both
NMake Makefile and Visual Studio 2015.

External libraries should be automatically downloaded and compiled by
the build system. You can also choose to download their sources
manually by replacing `deps/CMakeLists.txt` with
`deps/CMakeLists_uselocal.txt`. Note that you may need to change the
CMakeLists.txt of libzip manually to add the static library target.

You have to build the 32-bit and 64-bit versions separately. Using an
out-of-source build location is recommended.

Example build commands:

- Visual Studio 2015 64-bit build:

		cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" <path_to_source>
		cmake --build . --config Release

- NMake (within Visual Studio command prompt):

		cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <path_to_source>
		cmake --build .

Currently, the project does not include an install target. You will
have to copy the output manually or using an external script. The
output DLL is located at

	<build_dir>\KritaShellExtension\<config>\kritashellex##.dll

or

	<build_dir>\KritaShellExtension\kritashellex##.dll

depending on the generator you use, where ## is the target architecture.

To build the NSIS installer, refer to the readme file under
`installer/nsis`.


Additional Information
----------------------

### KritaThumbnailProvider ###

Provides preview thumbnail for .kra and .ora files.

### KritaPropertyHandler ###

Provides image file properties for .kra and .ora files. Additional
registry changes are needed for it to work the best.

### zip_source_IStream ###

Utility allowing libzip to read zip archives directly from the COM
interface IStream without needing to load the content of the entire
stream into memory beforehand, saving some time and reducing memory
usage.
